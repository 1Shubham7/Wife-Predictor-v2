## **About**
This app was created as a fun way for users to predict their future wives based on a database of images of women. The goal of the project is to create a diverse and inclusive database that accurately represents the many different types of people who exist in the world.

### **Technology Used**
This app is made with React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We also plan to add the Django REST framework as the backend in the future. Within these frameworks, we use various libraries and tools such as Bootstrap and React Router.
